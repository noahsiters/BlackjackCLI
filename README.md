####How Do I Play?
First the DEALER will deal the cards. You get TWO cards, your goal is to get to 21 without BUSTING. Each round you have a choice to HIT(H) or STAND(S).<br/><br/>

If you HIT, the dealer will add another CARD to your HAND. The closer your ttotal gets to 21, the better chances you have of winning.

If you go over 21, you BUST.

If you STAND, the dealer will then reveal his other card, then hit until he either BUSTS or WINS.
